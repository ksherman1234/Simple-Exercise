To build the assembler and run it, type in the command:
  python sas.py input file> >loop.scram
Our program is a SCRAM assembler which takes in a textual description and
translates it into a 6-byte SCRAM object file. The main function takes in a file
name as a command line argument. Then, it reads in from the file into a list and
eliminates blank lines. We encode into a map the instruction with its corresponding
code.
After that, the program then loops through the list of instructions and maps the
labels to addresses. We then loop through every item in the input list, convert
to bytes, and output the list of byte string. The program then prings to standard
out the byte list string.
